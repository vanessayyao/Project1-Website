            <h3>Watching TV</h3>
            <h5> My favorite TV show is probably "Survivor," where 18 people are stranded on an
            island. They have to create shelter/fire, complete challenges, and most
            importantly, strategize with each other to vote people out! The last one
            remaining is the winner :&rpar; </h5>

            <h5> I mostly only do this sporadically and when I need to destress, but I like
            the creative freedom of doodling whatever I want. Here's a sketch of a climber 
            I did recently: </h5>

            <h3>Ping Pong</h3>
            <h5>I first picked this up during the pandemic because we had a tiny kids' table 
                at home. I usually play with my twin sister, but since college started,
                I've been going to MLK sometimes to play with people there :D
                <br> Fun fact: I prefer forehand over backhand!
